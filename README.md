# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
This branch contains the scripts used for PCA for structural analysis in the development of PyPollen.
Many of these files are outdated and should be ignored, but are left in case needed. 'Principal Componenet Analysis.ipnyb' is the primary file which should be used. CSVs from the main branch will be needed locally.
